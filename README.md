Hi! My name is **Marjan** and Im just a nerd who likes computers and programming, and heres a little bit of GNU/Linux Copypasta:

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as **Linux**, is in fact, **GNU/Linux**, or as I've recently taken to calling it, **GNU** plus **Linux**. **Linux** is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning **GNU** system made useful by the **GNU** corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by **POSIX**.

Many computer users run a modified version of the **GNU** system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of **GNU** which is widely used today is often called **Linux**, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the **GNU** system, developed by the **GNU** Project.

There really is a **Linux**, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. **Linux** is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!

Alright, now that we are back id like to interject **myself**  for a moment, not all **Linux** distros are **GNU**, so what I want to say (and the text above probably said the same thing I just didnt bother reading it) is that not all **Linux** distributions are GNU, but almost all the popular ones are, which means that they combine the **Linux** kernel with the vast majority of **GNU** system software like *bash*, *coreutils*, *glibc*, etc...
Making them technically a **GNU** system with Linux as the kernel.

So when you are reffering to **Linux** you are probably thinking of a GNU System with the **Linux** kernel, or, MAYBE, you are reffering to something else, who knows 🤷.
